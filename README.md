# TwitchPlaysReverseJenga
a chaotic little game that I play with friends and turned into a twitch plays program as a challenge!
(SO far about 9 hours have been put into this project)
Official Channel: https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplaysreversejenga

# Setup
WARNING: My code is in an extremely prototype stage, its very broken at the moment, cope and seethe
1) Download repo
2) Create auth.txt file in res://twitch
	- This file should have three lines: your client_id, client_secret and channel_username
	- because this has our client_secret it is highly reccomended that you do not track this file in version control ect
3) Run the res://levels/jenga.tscn scene
	- if everything is working the game should now be able to receive commands
4) start your stream as per normal through obs/ect
5) build some towers!
